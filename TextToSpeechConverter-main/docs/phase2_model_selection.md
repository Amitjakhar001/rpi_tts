## Optimization for Raspberry Pi

Based on the performance analysis, the following optimizations are recommended for Raspberry Pi deployment:

1. Selected Model: Google TTS (Online)
   Rationale: Superior voice quality with acceptable performance
   Implementation:Requires internet connectivity, caching for frequently used phrases recommended

2. Resource Optimization:
   - Implement text preprocessing to remove unnecessary content
   - Cache frequently used phrases
   - Implement resource monitoring and throttling if CPU usage exceeds thresholds

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Raspberry Pi's limited CPU will increase processing time compared to laptop testing
   - Memory usage should remain consistent
   - For longer texts, consider implementing chunking to process text in manageable segments
